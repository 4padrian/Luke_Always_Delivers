#JAM DE CASA

JamDeCasa was a browser game challenge created to support the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants developed games within a short timeframe, and these games were shared online to raise awareness and funds for pandemic relief efforts. The initiative combined creativity and philanthropy, encouraging developers to contribute their skills to a global cause while offering engaging and entertaining content for players.

Below you can find the screenshots of the original website showing the challenge and my game entry named "Luke Always Delivers". Unfortunately the website is not live anymore.

Additionally, you can see my game presentation during the live stream in the youtube video below. It starts from timestamp 29:10.
